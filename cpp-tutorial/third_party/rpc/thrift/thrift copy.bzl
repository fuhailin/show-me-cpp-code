# Some notes on the raison d'etre of thrift_library vs. code gen specific
# targets. The idea is to be able to separate concerns -- thrift_library is
# concerned purely with the ownership and organization of thrift files. It
# is not concerned with what to do with them. Thus, the code gen specific
# targets  will take the graph of thrift_libraries and use them to generate
# code. This organization is useful because it means that if there are
# different code generation targets, we don't need to have a whole separate
# tree of targets organizing the thrifts per code gen paradigm.

        # should serve as the base for the import... for example, if a file is

        # than one in different parts of the tree. Another option is to take an argument
        # that references namespace, and base the tree off of that. The downside
        # to that is that thrift_library then gets enmeshed in the details of code
        # generation. This could also be something punted to scrooge_scala_library
